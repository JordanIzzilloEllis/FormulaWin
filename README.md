A web-app designed to show race results for the most recent Formula 1 Grand Prix.

This webapp shows race results when loaded for the most recent Grand Prix, however the goal is to eventually make details of all races available to the user. I'm also aiming to add more detailed information about Drivers, their Teams (Constructors) and the seasons standings.

Currently it's all running on one JavaScript file but my next task is to split it into Front-End & Back-End. Once this conversion is done, I'll be making it so that the Back-End stores the race schedule, enabling it to update as soon as the source API updates. Then I can add the next small change which would be a race countdown on the main page, so users know how long it is until the next race is held.
