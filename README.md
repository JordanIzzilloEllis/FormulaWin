# FormulaWin
A web-app designed to show race results for the most recent Formula 1 Grand Prix.

The backend was created using Node.js; to run the app, enter 'node index.js' in the terminal of a computer with node installed, then load the HTML file. Alternatively, if you don't have/want Node.js installed, simply change the <script> source file in formulaResults.html from app.js to formulaResults.js.

This webapp shows race results when loaded for the most recent Grand Prix, however the goal is to eventually make details of all races available to the user. I'm also aiming to add more detailed information about Drivers, their Teams (Constructors) and the seasons standings.

In its current state, I havent added in the other pages yet, so the front page is the only one with any functionality. I plan to eventually have all pages finished, and have been considering adding 3d models of the cars to either the Driver's pages, Constructor's pages or both.

I'll be making it so that the Back-End stores the race schedule, enabling it to update as soon as the source API updates. Then I can add the next small change which would be a race countdown on the main page, so users know how long it is until the next race is held.  

This is currently a work in progress and as such, nothing you're seeing is completely finished just yet.
